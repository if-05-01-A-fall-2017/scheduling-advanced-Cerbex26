1)
5 schedules

2)
Process A: 142,5
Process B: 102,5

Process B will be taken because the time is shorter than the time of process A.

3)
CPU-bound processes: Processes without a user interface (no IO). 
I/O-bound processes: Processes with a high user interaction.
It is important because CPU-Bound processes need high quanta but low priority whereas I/O-Bound processes need low quanta and high 
priority. The scheduler has to identify which processes need a specific amount of quanta and priority.


4)
35/50 + 20/100 + 10/200 = 19/20 -> 0,05

x/250 = 1 - 0,05
x/250 = 0,95 -> x = 0,95 * 250 = 12,5s
